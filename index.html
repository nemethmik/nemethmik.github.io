<h2 style="text-align: center;">PRIVACY POLICY FOR TIVA11 MOBILE APPLICATIONS</h2> <p></p> 
<p>
    This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Man Over Board (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by&nbsp;Tiva11 Mobile Solutions.
    &nbsp;The Application is&nbsp;
    a wearable application and when started it automatically records the GPS location and starts tracking where Man Over Board (MOB) happened by showing the direction (bearing) and distance in meters. 
    Even when the application is not active, it remembers the last MOB location for 30 minutes, and when resumed it continues tracking. 
    It has two screens, the first one showing the details of the MOB event: MOB location, current location, current time (since this is a clock), 
    the expired seconds since the MOB event, the distance and the bearing. The other screen shows a compass. 
    You can simply swipe from left to right and back between the screens. 
    The application is not sending the MOB location to anywhere.&nbsp;
